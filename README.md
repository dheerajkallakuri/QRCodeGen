# QR Code Generator App

## Project Overview
The main aim of this project is to create a QR code for any website submitted via the app. The app provides a user-friendly interface for generating customizable QR codes with different patterns, colors, and sizes. It also validates the submitted URL and allows users to save the generated QR code with a timestamped filename.

## Project Structure
The project consists of two main Python files:

1. **`app.py`** (Frontend using PyQt5)
2. **`qrcode_gen.py`** (QR Code generation and URL validation logic)

### `app.py`
This file contains the frontend code for the app built with PyQt5. The app provides:
- An input field to enter the URL for which a QR code is to be generated.
- Two buttons:
  1. **Generate QR Code**: Generates a QR code with random patterns, colors, and backgrounds.
  2. **Save QR Code**: Saves the generated QR code with a default timestamped filename.
- A display area that shows the QR code once it is generated. Each time the "Generate QR Code" button is clicked, a new QR code with a different design is displayed.
  
Additional features:
- If the URL entered is invalid, an error message is displayed, asking the user to input a valid URL.
- Once the QR code is saved, a popup message confirms that the QR code has been successfully saved.

### `qrcode_gen.py`
This file contains the core logic for QR code generation and URL validation:
- **`generate_qr_code` function**: This function is called by `app.py` to generate the QR code when the user clicks the "Generate QR Code" button.
- URL validation is also handled in this file, ensuring the URL format is correct before generating the QR code.
- QR codes are generated with random patterns, colors, and fixed sizes, offering a variety of styles.
- QR codes are saved with a default timestamp as filename in a specified folder.

## Results
